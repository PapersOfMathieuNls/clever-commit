@article{Field2009,
abstract = {Our aim is to define the kernel of a simple and uniform programming model–the reactor model–which can serve as a foundation for building and evolving internet-scale programs. Such programs are characterized by collections of loosely-coupled distributed components that are assembled on the fly to produce a composite application. A reactor consists of two principal components: mutable state, in the form of a fixed collection of relations, and code, in the form of a fixed collection of rules in the style of Datalog. A reactor's code is executed in response to an external stimulus, which takes the form of an attempted update to the reactor's state. As in classical process calculi, the reactor model accommodates collections of distributed, concurrently executing processes. However, unlike classical process calculi, our observable behaviors are sequences of states, rather than sequences of messages. Similarly, the interface to a reactor is simply its state, rather than a collection of message channels, ports, or methods. One novel feature of our model is the ability to compose behaviors both synchronously and asynchronously. Also, our use of Datalog-style rules allows aspect-like composition of separately-specified functional concerns in a natural way.},

However, existing tools sometimes yield so many warnings that developers tend to ignore such warnings. To deal with this problem, we propose a gamified tool for motivating developers to remove such warnings. Our tool employs the gamification technique that calculates points by counting removed warnings with respect to each developer and each team. The points give developers feedback and urge them to compete with each other. We confirmed that developers removed about 150{\%} warnings with our tool in comparison with the case where they did not use our tool through an experiment.},

abstract = {Although researchers have begun to explicitly support end-user programmers' debugging by providing information to help them find bugs, there is little research addressing the proper mechanism to alert the user to this information. The choice of alerting mechanism can be important, because as previous research has shown, different interruption styles have different potential advantages and disadvantages. To explore impacts of interruptions in the end-user debugging domain, this paper describes an empirical comparison of two interruption styles that have been used to alert end-user programmers to debugging information. Our results show that negotiated-style interruptions were superior to immediate-style interruptions in several issues of importance to end-user debugging, and further suggest that a reason for this superiority may be that immediate-style interruptions encourage different debugging strategies.},

abstract = {Much of software developers' time is spent understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\{}{\AA}{\}} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\{}{\%}{\}} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\{}{\%}{\}} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\{}{\%}{\}} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSIBLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.},

abstract = {To remain competitive in the fast paced world of software development, managers must optimize the usage of their limited resources to deliver quality products on time and within budget. In this paper, we present an approach (the top ten list) which highlights to managers the ten most susceptible subsystems (directories) to have a fault. Managers can focus testing resources to the subsystems suggested by the list. The list is updated dynamically as the development of the system progresses. We present heuristics to create the top ten list and develop techniques to measure the performance of these heuristics. To validate our work, we apply our presented approach to six large open source projects (three operating systems: NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD; a window manager: KDE; an office productivity suite: KOffice; and a database management system: Postgres). Furthermore, we examine the benefits of increasing the size of the top ten list and study its performance.},

@article{Ko2006a,
abstract = {Much of software developers' time is spent understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner},

abstract = {The presence of crosscutting concerns, i.e., functionalities that are not assigned to a single modular unit in the implementation, is one of the major problems in software understanding and evolution. In fact, they are hard to locate (scattering) and may give rise to multiple ripple effects (tangling). Aspect oriented programming offers mechanisms to factor them out into a modular unit, called an aspect. Aspect identification in existing code is supported by means of dynamic code analysis. Execution traces are generated for the use cases that exercise the main functionalities of the given application. The relationship between execution traces and executed computational units (class methods) is subjected to concept analysis. In the resulting lattice, potential aspects are detected by determining the use-case specific concepts and examining their specific computational units. When these come from multiple modules (classes) which contribute to multiple use-cases, a candidate aspect is recognized.},

Phalgune, Impact of interruption style on end-user debugging, ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2004)], we delve deeper into the question of which interruption style best supports end-user debugging. Previously, we found no advantages of immediate-style interruptions (which force the user to divert attention to the interruption at hand) over negotiated-style interruptions (which notify users without actually preventing them from working) in supporting end-user debugging. In this study, we altered our negotiated-style interruptions [A. Wilson, M. Burnett, L. Beckwith, O. Granatir, L. Casburn, C. Cook, M. Durham, G. Rothermel, Harnessing curiosity to increase correctness in end-user programming, Proceedings of the CHI 2003 (2003), 305-312] (which were shown to help end-user debuggers learn about and use debugging features of our programming language) such that they were more intense (larger, blinking, and/or accompanied by text). {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Kim2007c,
abstract = {Automatic bug-finding tools have a high false positive rate: most warnings do not indicate real bugs. Usually bug-finding tools assign important warnings high priority. However, the prioritization of tools tends to be ineffective. We observed the warnings output by three bug-finding tools, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD, for three subject programs, Columba, Lucene, and Scarab. Only 6{\%}, 9{\%}, and 9{\%} of warnings are removed by bug fix changes during 1 to 4 years of the software development. About 90{\%} of warnings remain in the program or are removed during non-fix changes - likely false positive warnings. The tools' warning prioritization is little help in focusing on important warnings: the maximum possible precision by selecting high-priority warning instances is only 3{\%}, 12{\%}, and 8{\%} respectively. In this paper, we propose a history-based warning prioritization algorithm by mining warning fix experience that is recorded in the software change history. The underlying intuition is that if warnings from a category are eliminated by fix-changes, the warnings are important. Our prioritization algorithm improves warning precision to 17{\%}, 25{\%}, and 67{\%} respectively.},

abstract = {Most existing fault-localization techniques focus on identifying and reporting single statements that may contain a fault. Even in cases where a fault involves a single statement, it is generally hard to understand the fault by looking at that statement in isolation. Faults typically manifest themselves in a specific context, and knowing that context is necessary to diagnose and correct the fault. In this paper, we present a novel fault-localization technique that identifies sequences of statements that lead to a failure. The technique works by analyzing partial execution traces corresponding to failing executions and identifying common segments in these traces, incrementally. Our approach provides developers a context that is likely to result in a more directed approach to fault understanding and a lower overall cost for debugging.},

@article{Murphy-Hill2012,
abstract = {Software developers interact with the development environments they use by issuing commands that execute various programming tools, from source code formatters to build tools. However, developers often only use a small subset of the commands offered by modern development environments, reducing their overall development fluency. In this paper, we use several existing command recommender algorithms to suggest new commands to developers based on their existing command usage history, and also introduce several new algorithms. By running these algorithms on data submitted by several thousand Eclipse users, we describe two studies that explore the feasibility of automatically recommending commands to software developers. The results suggest that, while recommendation is more difficult in development environments than in other domains, it is still feasible to automatically recommend commands to developers based on their usage history, and that using patterns of past discovery is a useful way to do so.},

abstract = {Automatic bug finding tools tend to have high false positive rates: most warnings do not indicate real bugs. Usually bug finding tools prioritize each warning category. For example, the priority of "overflow " is 1 and the priority of "jumbled incremental" is 3, but the tools 'prioritization is not very effective. In this paper, we prioritize warning categories by analyzing the software change history. The underlying intuition is that if warnings from a category are resolved quickly by developers, the warnings in the category are important. Experiments with three bug finding tools (FindBugs, JLint, and PMD) and two open source projects (Columba and jEdit) indicate that different warning categories have very different lifetimes. Based on that observation, we propose a preliminary algorithm for warning category prioritizing.},

This problem arises in the context of merging different versions or variants of a business process model or when comparing business process models in order to display their similarities and differences. The paper investigates two approaches to this alignment problem: one based purely on lexical matching of pairs of elements and another based on error-correcting graph matching. Using a set of models taken from real-life scenarios, the paper empirically shows that graph matching techniques yield a significantly higher precision than pure lexical matching, while achieving comparable recall.},

@book{Daigneau2011,
abstract = {Web services have been used for many years. In this time, developers and architects have encountered a number of recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have learned that certain service design approaches work better than others to solve certain problems.    In   Service Design Patterns,   Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions for web services that follow the REST architectural style or leverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies the fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common design patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context in which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements, and explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples are provided to help you better understand how the patterns work but are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be applied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in the years to come.   This book will help readers answer the following questions:  How do you create a web service API, what are the common API styles, and when should a particular style be used?   How can clients and web services communicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex conversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended periods of time?   What are the options for implementing web service logic, and when should a particular approach be used?   How can clients become less coupled to the underlying systems used by a service?   How can information about a web service be discovered?   How can generic functions like authentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on the client or service?   What changes to a service cause clients to break?   What are the common ways to version a service? How can web services be designed to support the continuing evolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly upgrade?  This book is an invaluable resource for enterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use web services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or open source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products that leverage emerging Cloud platforms.},

abstract = {Software developers interact with the development environments they use by issuing commands that execute various programming tools, from source code formatters to build tools. However, developers often only use a small subset of the commands offered by modern development environments, reducing their overall development fluency. In this paper, we use several existing command recommender algorithms to suggest new commands to developers based on their existing command usage history, and also introduce several new algorithms. By running these algorithms on data submitted by several thousand Eclipse users, we describe two studies that explore the feasibility of automatically recommending commands to software developers. The results suggest that, while recommendation is more difficult in development environments than in other domains, it is still feasible to automatically recommend commands to developers based on their usage history, and that using patterns of past discovery is a useful way to do so.},

@article{Ko2006c,
abstract = {Much of software developers' time is spent understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner},

abstract = {Netscape enjoyed a 90{\%} installed user base for its Navigator browser in August 1995 while the market share for Microsoft's inferior quality browser was negligible. By August 1999, Microsoft had captured 76{\%} of the browser market. Extant theory has focused on late entrants' ability to win standards competitions through the development of products with superior quality/price performance. Yet this does not explain Microsoft's success. Microsoft succeeded by leveraging installed user bases across vertically related markets, from Windows to IE. To date, little or no attention has been paid to the leveraging installed user bases. This paper addresses this by developing an analytical framework, based on a coupled Polya Urn model, that captures the dynamics of the Netscape–Microsoft battle. The framework highlights the strategic potency of controlling a proprietary standard in a vertically related market.},

@phdthesis{Layman2009a,
abstract = {Software engineers undertaking maintenance tasks often work on unfamiliar code, requiring developers to search for, relate, and collect information relevant to the maintenance task. The goal of this research is to create theories that describe the nature of information sought by developers and how that information is used by developers during two types of maintenance tasks: debugging (corrective maintenance) and enhancement (perfective maintenance). To meet this goal, six hypotheses are investigated regarding the navigation activities undertaken by developers to identify, relate, and collect information during software maintenance tasks.                 These hypotheses were investigated using data from two empirical studies of 18 developers performing enhancement and debugging tasks on three Java programs. Video recordings were used to annotate user interaction logs to create a history of user activities during the maintenance tasks. These data described the activities developers undertake during maintenance tasks, what source code elements the developers examined, and the amount of time developers spent performing various activities. These data were analyzed using a combination of statistical and qualitative methods to compare the different methods of searching for and collecting information relevant to the software maintenance tasks.                 Analysis of the data showed that the navigation styles used by developers (static navigation, normal navigation, and keyword searching) to find information differ significantly in the amount of time spent collecting information. Furthermore, static navigation techniques were significantly shorter in duration than keyword search techniques. No statistically significant differences were observed in the amount of time developers spent collecting information in debugging and enhancement tasks. During debugging tasks, developers focused on information that controlled the state and behavior a particular element. During enhancement tasks, developers focused on how a element used other elements, rather than how an element is used by other elements.                 The analysis of the code relationships motivated further study of the nature of the information gathered by developers in enhancement and debugging tasks. The information read by developers (source code, Java documentation, and web search results) was analyzed with respect to the content of the information, how the information was related to the task and code elements being investigated, and how the information was used. This qualitative analysis led to the following new theories on software maintenance:  Theory 1 : Developers are less likely to progress toward completing a maintenance task when the correct implementation of new code or correct editing of existing code requires logical connections and/or evaluations of other code elements. Theory 2 : New code that has been duplicated from another source acts as a self-reference, thereby requiring developers to make fewer logical evaluations and increasing the likelihood the duplicated information will be successfully used in completing a task. Theory 3 : Specific software behavior is often identified through analysis of a sequence of events and the control structures that propagate those events through the system, whereas a functional concept is often identified through comparisons, similarities, and references of existing functionality.                 These theories are new contributions to the field of software maintenance and program comprehension theory. These theories can be further evaluated to help guide the creation of tools and strategies for assisting developers in finding relevant information during software maintenance tasks. One such tool, the Mimec Spotlight, has been proposed and evaluated in this research.},

It can detect potential security violations (SQL injection), runtime errors (dereferencing a null pointer) and logical inconsistencies (a conditional test that can't possibly be true). Although a rich body of literature exists on algorithms and analytical frameworks used by such tools, reports describing experiences in industry are much harder to come by. The authors describe FindBugs, an open source static-analysis tool for Java, and experiences using it in production settings. FindBugs evaluates what kinds of defects can be effectively detected with relatively simple techniques and helps developers understand how to incorporate such tools into software development.},

abstract = {Determined empirically the optimal number of alternatives for likert type scales. 360 students were used to test the 18 different likert type formats. 60 value statements were rated by ss on likert scales ranging from 2-19 points. In addition, each s was readministered the same form 3 wk. Later. The reliability and validity data for the different scales were then compared. Results show that (a) there were no specific patterns for reliability or validity coefficients using different number of alternatives; and (b) when the original scales were dichotomized or trichotomized, no significant differences were found in reliability or validity. Implications for users of rating scales are discussed. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {When programs fail in the field, developers are often left with limited information to diagnose the failure. Automated error reporting tools can assist in bug report generation but without precise steps from the end user it is often difficult for developers to recreate the failure. Advanced remote debugging tools aim to capture sufficient information from field executions to recreate failures in the lab but often have too much overhead to practically deploy. We present Chronicler, an approach to remote debugging that captures non-deterministic inputs to applications in a lightweight manner, assuring faithful reproduction of client executions. We evaluated Chronicler by creating a Java implementation, ChroniclerJ, and then by using a set of benchmarks mimicking real world applications and workloads, showing its runtime overhead to be under 10{\%} in most cases (worst case 86{\%}), while an existing tool showed overhead over 100{\%} in the same cases (worst case 2,322{\%}).},

abstract = {Copyright c fl1995 by the authors. All rights reserved. This paper identifies and analyzes the emergence of a new paradigm in software engineering, called separation of concerns, which tries to formally separate the basic algorithm from special purpose concerns such as synchronization, real-time constraints, and location control. This separation allows for the locality of different kinds of information in the programs, making them easier to write, understand, reuse, and modify. We identify the major concerns existing in today{\&}{\#}039;s software applications, and analyze recent proposals in the literature that address separation of single concerns. Furthermore, we study the commonalities of these proposals and discuss how they can be used to achieve separation of concerns in general. Finally, we address the problem of composition of several separated concerns.},

abstract = {Earlier research on gender effects with software features intended to help problem-solvers in end-user debugging environments has shown that females are less likely to use unfamiliar software features. This poses a serious problem because these features may be key to helping them with debugging problems. Contrasting this with research documenting males' inclination for tinkering in unfamiliar environments, the question arises as to whether encouraging tinkering with new features would help females overcome the factors, such as low self-efficacy, that led to the earlier results. In this paper, we present an experiment with males and females in an end-user debugging setting, and investigate how tinkering behavior impacts several measures of their debugging success. Our results show that the factors of tinkering, reflection, and self-efficacy, can combine in multiple ways to impact debugging effectiveness differently for males than for females.

abstract = {Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious?even liberating?book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. "The Design of Everyday Things" shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Donald A. Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, "The Design of Everyday Things" is a powerful primer on how?and why?some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

abstract = {Automated planning technology now plays a significant role in a variety of demanding applications, ranging from controlling space vehicles and robots to playing the game of bridge. These real-world applications create new opportunities for synergy between theory and practice: observing what works well in practice leads to better theories of planning, and better theories lead to better performance of practical applications. Automated Planning mirrors this dialogue by offering a comprehensive, up-to-date resource on both the theory and practice of automated planning. The book goes well beyond classical planning, to include temporal planning, resource scheduling, planning under uncertainty, and modern techniques for plan generation, such as task decomposition, propositional satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, and model checking. The authors combine over 30 years experience in planning research and development to offer an invaluable text to researchers, professionals, and graduate students. *Comprehensively explains paradigms for automated planning. *Provides a thorough understanding of theory and planning practice, and how they relate to each other. *Presents case studies of applications in space, robotics, CAD/CAM, process control, emergency operations, and games.*Provides a thorough understanding of AI planning theory and practice, and how they relate to each other. *Covers all the contemporary topics of planning, as well as important practical applications of planning, such as model checking and game playing. *Presents case studies and applications in planning engineering, space, robotics, CAD/CAM, process control, emergency operations, and games.*Provides lecture notes, examples of programming assignments, pointers to downloadable planning systems and related information online.},

While mining literature has been almost exclusively focused on frequent itemsets, in many practical situations rare ones are of higher interest (e.g., in medical databases, rare combinations of symptoms might provide useful insights for the physicians). Based on an examination of the relevant substructures of the mining space, our approach splits the rare itemset mining task into two steps, i.e., frequent itemset part traversal and rare itemset listing. We propose two algorithms for step one, a naive and an optimized one, respectively, and another algorithm for step two. We also provide some empirical evidence about the performance gains due to the optimized traversal.},

abstract = {Most current designs of information technology are based on the notion of supporting distinct tasks such as document production, email usage, and voice communication. In this paper we present empirical results that suggest that people organize their work in terms of much larger and thematically connected units of work. We present results of fieldwork observation of information workers in three different roles: analysts, software developers, and managers. We discovered that all of these types of workers experience a high level of discontinuity in the execution of their activities. People average about three minutes on a task and somewhat more than two minutes using any electronic tool or paper document before switching tasks. We introduce the concept of working spheres to explain the inherent way in which individuals conceptualize and organize their basic units of work. People worked in an average of ten different working spheres. Working spheres are also fragmented; people spend about 12 minutes in a working sphere before they switch to another. We argue that design of information technology needs to support people's continual switching between working spheres.},

@phdthesis{Layman2009,
abstract = {Software engineers undertaking maintenance tasks often work on unfamiliar code, requiring developers to search for, relate, and collect information relevant to the maintenance task. The goal of this research is to create theories that describe the nature of information sought by developers and how that information is used by developers during two types of maintenance tasks: debugging (corrective maintenance) and enhancement (perfective maintenance). To meet this goal, six hypotheses are investigated regarding the navigation activities undertaken by developers to identify, relate, and collect information during software maintenance tasks.                 These hypotheses were investigated using data from two empirical studies of 18 developers performing enhancement and debugging tasks on three Java programs. Video recordings were used to annotate user interaction logs to create a history of user activities during the maintenance tasks. These data described the activities developers undertake during maintenance tasks, what source code elements the developers examined, and the amount of time developers spent performing various activities. These data were analyzed using a combination of statistical and qualitative methods to compare the different methods of searching for and collecting information relevant to the software maintenance tasks.                 Analysis of the data showed that the navigation styles used by developers (static navigation, normal navigation, and keyword searching) to find information differ significantly in the amount of time spent collecting information. Furthermore, static navigation techniques were significantly shorter in duration than keyword search techniques. No statistically significant differences were observed in the amount of time developers spent collecting information in debugging and enhancement tasks. During debugging tasks, developers focused on information that controlled the state and behavior a particular element. During enhancement tasks, developers focused on how a element used other elements, rather than how an element is used by other elements.                 The analysis of the code relationships motivated further study of the nature of the information gathered by developers in enhancement and debugging tasks. The information read by developers (source code, Java documentation, and web search results) was analyzed with respect to the content of the information, how the information was related to the task and code elements being investigated, and how the information was used. This qualitative analysis led to the following new theories on software maintenance:  Theory 1 : Developers are less likely to progress toward completing a maintenance task when the correct implementation of new code or correct editing of existing code requires logical connections and/or evaluations of other code elements. Theory 2 : New code that has been duplicated from another source acts as a self-reference, thereby requiring developers to make fewer logical evaluations and increasing the likelihood the duplicated information will be successfully used in completing a task. Theory 3 : Specific software behavior is often identified through analysis of a sequence of events and the control structures that propagate those events through the system, whereas a functional concept is often identified through comparisons, similarities, and references of existing functionality.                 These theories are new contributions to the field of software maintenance and program comprehension theory. These theories can be further evaluated to help guide the creation of tools and strategies for assisting developers in finding relevant information during software maintenance tasks. One such tool, the Mimec Spotlight, has been proposed and evaluated in this research.},

abstract = {Bug fixing accounts for a large amount of the software maintenance resources. Generally, bugs are reported, fixed, verified and closed. However, in some cases bugs have to be re-opened. Re-opened bugs increase maintenance costs, degrade the overall user-perceived quality of the software and lead to unnecessary rework by busy practitioners. In this paper, we study and predict re-opened bugs through a case study on three large open source projects-namely Eclipse, Apache and OpenOffice. We structure our study along four dimensions: (1) the work habits dimension (e.g., the weekday on which the bug was initially closed), (2) the bug report dimension (e.g., the component in which the bug was found) (3) the bug fix dimension (e.g., the amount of time it took to perform the initial fix) and (4) the team dimension (e.g., the experience of the bug fixer). We build decision trees using the aforementioned factors that aim to predict re-opened bugs. We perform top node analysis to determine which factors are the most important indicators of whether or not a bug will be re-opened. Our study shows that the comment text and last status of the bug when it is initially closed are the most important factors related to whether or not a bug will be re-opened. Using a combination of these dimensions, we can build explainable prediction models that can achieve a precision between 52.1-78.6 {\%} and a recall in the range of 70.5-94.1 {\%} when predicting whether a bug will be re-opened. We find that the factors that best indicate which bugs might be re-opened vary based on the project. The comment text is the most important factor for the Eclipse and OpenOffice projects, while the last status is the most important one for Apache. These factors should be closely examined in order to reduce maintenance cost due to re-opened bugs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Metrics are paramount in every engineering discipline. Software engineering, however, is not considered a classical engineering activity for several reasons. In general, if a software system is seen to deliver the required functionality, only few people if any care about the internals. Moreover, defining, understanding and applying software metrics often looks like an overly complex activity, recommended only to 'trained professionals'. Lanza and Marinescu demystify the design metrics used to assess the size, quality and complexity of object-oriented software systems. Based on statistical information from many industrial projects and generally accepted semantics they deduce many single and combined threshold values. They show in detail how to identify collaboration and classification disharmony patterns in code, how to visualize their results using the freely available CodeCrawler visualization tool, and how to devise possible remedies. The combination of theoretically sound results and practically tested procedures and solution paths makes this book an ideal companion for professional software architects, developers and quality engineers. The pattern-oriented description of disharmonies offers easy access to detecting shortcomings and applying solution strategies. 'This well-written book is an important piece of work that takes the seemingly forgotten art of object-oriented metrics to the next level in terms of relevance and usefulness.' Richard C.

@article{Trafton2003,
abstract = {We examine people's strategic cognitive responses to being interrupted while performing a task. Based on memory theory, we propose that resumption of a task after interruption is facilitated by preparation during the interruption lag, or the interval between an alert to a pending interruption (e.g. the phone ringing) and the interruption proper (the ensuing conversation). To test this proposal, we conducted an experiment in which participants in a Warning condition received an 8-s interruption lag, and participants in an Immediate condition received no interruption lag. Participants in the Warning condition prepared more than participants in the Immediate condition, as measured by verbal reports, and resumed the interrupted task more quickly. However, Immediate participants resumed faster with practice, suggesting that people adapt to particularly disruptive forms of interruption. The results support our task analysis of interruption and our model of memory for goals, and suggest further means for studying operator performance in dynamic task environments.},

@article{Baker2002,
abstract = {Sparse Dynamic Programming has emerged as an essential tool for the design of efficient algorithms for optimization problems coming from such diverse areas as computer science, computational biology, and speech recognition. We provide a new sparse dynamic programming technique that extends the Hunt–Szymanski paradigm for the computation of the longest common subsequence (LCS) and apply it to solve the LCS from Fragments problem: given a pair of strings X and Y (of length n and m, respectively) and a set M of matching substrings of X and Y, find the longest common subsequence based only on the symbol correspondences induced by the substrings. This problem arises in an application to analysis of software systems. Our algorithm solves the problem in O(|M|log|M|) time using balanced trees, or O(|M|loglogmin(|M|,nm/|M|)) time using Johnson's version of Flat Trees. These bounds apply for two cost measures. The algorithm can also be adapted to finding the usual LCS in O((m+n)log|$\Sigma$|+|M|log|M|) time using balanced trees or O((m+n)log|$\Sigma$|+|M|loglogmin(|M|,nm/|M|)) time using Johnson's version of Flat Trees, where M is the set of maximal matches between substrings of X and Y and $\Sigma$ is the alphabet. These bounds improve on those of the original Hunt–Szymanski algorithm while retaining the overall approach.},

It can detect potential security violations (SQL injection), runtime errors (dereferencing a null pointer) and logical inconsistencies (a conditional test that can't possibly be true). Although a rich body of literature exists on algorithms and analytical frameworks used by such tools, reports describing experiences in industry are much harder to come by. The authors describe FindBugs, an open source static-analysis tool for Java, and experiences using it in production settings. FindBugs evaluates what kinds of defects can be effectively detected with relatively simple techniques and helps developers understand how to incorporate such tools into software development.},

@article{Ko2006b,
abstract = {Much of software developers' time is spent understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse's navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed would be necessary to edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse's package explorer, file tabs, and scroll bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner},

abstract = {Software system analysis for extracting system functionality remains as a major problem in the reverse engineering literature and the early approaches mainly rely on static properties of software. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for dynamic analysis of software systems to identify the implementation of the software features that are specified through a number of feature-specific task scenarios. The execution of task scenarios and application of data mining algorithm sequential pattern discovery on the generated traces allow us to extract common functionality associated with the corresponding feature-specific task scenarios. The extracted patterns are used to identify the groups of core functions that implement software features. The proposed approach can be used for program comprehension and feature to source code assignment. A case study on the Unix Xfig drawing tool has been provided},

In addition, each s was readministered the same form 3 wk. Later. The reliability and validity data for the different scales were then compared. Results show that (a) there were no specific patterns for reliability or validity coefficients using different number of alternatives; and (b) when the original scales were dichotomized or trichotomized, no significant differences were found in reliability or validity. Implications for users of rating scales are discussed. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The sixth edition continues to lead the way in software engineering. A new Part 4 on Web Engineering presents a complete engineering approach for the analysis, design, and testing of Web Applications, increasingly important for today's students. Additionally, the UML coverage has been enhanced and signficantly increased in this new edition.The pedagogy has also been improved in the new edition to include sidebars. They provide information on relevant softare tools, specific work flow for specific kinds of projects, and additional information on various topics. Additionally, Pressman provides a running case study called "Safe Home" throughout the book, which provides the application of software engineering to an industry project. New additions to the book also include chapters on the Agile Process Models, Requirements Engineering, and Design Engineering. The book has been completely updated and contains hundreds of new references to software tools that address all important topics in the book.The ancillary material for the book includes an expansion of the case study, which illustrates it with UML diagrams. The On-Line Learning Center includes resources for both instructors and students such as checklists, 700 categorized web references, Powerpoints, a test bank, and a software engineering library-containing over 500 software engineering papers.TAKEAWY HERE IS THE FOLLOWING:1.

Based on the needs of software professionals, "Practical Software Testing" takes a unique approach to teaching readers how to effectively plan for testing, design test cases, test at multiple levels, organize a testing team, and optimize use of testing tools. It introduces testing concepts that are managerial-, technical-, and process-oriented, using the Testing Maturity Model (TMM) as a framework. Features: *includes a sample test plan, comprehensive exercises, and definitions for software testing and quality *introduces both technical and managerial aspects of testing in a clear and precise style, for integrated learning *balanced perspective and comprehensive view of all testing aspects *uses the TMM framework to introduce testing in a systematic, evolutionary way, and describes industrial TMM applications *covers testing topics with either procedurally based or object-oriented programming code With its accessible, practical, and well-focused framework, this new resource provides an integrated presentation of software-testing processes and practices. Professionals and practitioners in software testing, software quality assurance, or software validation and verification will benefit greatly from using this essential resource.},

@article{Shang2013,
abstract = {Platform software plays an important role in speeding up the development of large scale applications. Such platforms provide functionalities and abstraction on which applications can be rapidly developed and easily deployed. Hadoop and JBoss are examples of popular open source platform software. Such platform software generate logs to assist operators in monitoring the applications that run on them. These logs capture the doubts, concerns, and needs of developers and operators of platform software. We believe that such logs can be used to better understand code quality. However, logging characteristics and their relation to quality has never been explored. In this paper, we sought to empirically study this relation through a case study on four releases of Hadoop and JBoss. Our findings show that files with logging statements have higher post-release defect densities than those without logging statements in 7 out of 8 studied releases. Inspired by prior studies on code quality, we defined log-related product metrics, such as the number of log lines in a file, and log-related process metrics such as the number of changed log lines. We find that the correlations between our log-related metrics and post-release defects are as strong as their correlations with traditional process metrics, such as the number of pre-release defects, which is known to be one the metrics with the strongest correlation with post-release defects. We also find that log-related metrics can complement traditional product and process metrics resulting in up to 40 {\%} improvement in explanatory power of defect proneness. Our results show that logging characteristics provide strong indicators of defect-prone source code files. However, we note that removing logs is not the answer to better code quality. Instead, our results show that it might be the case that developers often relay their concerns about a piece of code through logs. Hence, code quality improvement efforts (e.g., testing and inspection) should focus more on the source code files with large amounts of logs or with large amounts of log churn. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Software developers interact with the development environments they use by issuing commands that execute various programming tools, from source code formatters to build tools. However, developers often only use a small subset of the commands offered by modern development environments, reducing their overall development fluency. In this paper, we use several existing command recommender algorithms to suggest new commands to developers based on their existing command usage history, and also introduce several new algorithms. By running these algorithms on data submitted by several thousand Eclipse users, we describe two studies that explore the feasibility of automatically recommending commands to software developers. The results suggest that, while recommendation is more difficult in development environments than in other domains, it is still feasible to automatically recommend commands to developers based on their usage history, and that using patterns of past discovery is a useful way to do so.},

@article{Fournier-Viger2012,
abstract = {Sequential rule mining is an important data mining task used in a wide range of applications. However, current algorithms for discovering sequential rules common to several sequences use very restrictive definitions of sequential rules, which make them unable to recognize that similar rules can describe a same phenomenon. This can have many undesirable effects such as (1) similar rules that are rated differently, (2) rules that are not found because they are considered uninteresting when taken individually, (3) and rules that are too specific, which makes them less likely to be used for making predictions. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a more general form of sequential rules such that items in the antecedent and in the consequent of each rule are unordered. We propose an algorithm named CMRules for mining this form of rules. The algorithm proceeds by first finding association rules to prune the search space for items that occur jointly in many sequences. Then it eliminates association rules that do not meet the minimum confidence and support thresholds according to the sequential ordering. We evaluate the performance of CMRules in three different ways. First, we provide an analysis of its time complexity. Second, we compare its performance (in terms of execution time, memory usage and scalability) with an adaptation of an algorithm from the literature that we name CMDeo. For this comparison, we use three real-life public datasets, which have different characteristics and represent three kinds of data. In many cases, results show that CMRules is faster and has a better scalability for low support thresholds than CMDeo. Lastly, we report a successful application of the algorithm in a tutoring agent.},

@article{Harel1987,
abstract = {We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressive—small diagrams can express complex behavior—as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system.},

abstract = {Bugs in software are costly and difficult to find and fix. In recent years, many tools and techniques have been developed for automatically finding bugs by analyzing source code or intermediate code statically (at compile time). Different tools and techniques have different tradeoffs, but the practical impact of these tradeoffs is not well understood. In this paper, we apply five bug finding tools, specifically Bandera, ESC/Java 2, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD, to a variety of Java programs. By using a variety of tools, we are able to cross-check their bug reports and warnings. Our experimental results show that none of the tools strictly subsumes another, and indeed the tools often find nonoverlapping bugs. We discuss the techniques each of the tools is based on, and we suggest how particular techniques affect the output of the tools. Finally, we propose a meta-tool that combines the output of the tools together, looking for particular lines of code, methods, and classes that many tools warn about.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown the promise of using utility functions to detect anomalous behavior in software systems at runtime. However, it remains a challenge for software engineers to hand-craft a utility function that achieves both a high precision (i.e., few false alarms) and a high recall (i.e., few undetected faults). This paper describes a technique that uses genetic programming to automatically evolve a utility function for a specific system, set of resource usage metrics, and precision/recall preference. These metrics are computed using sensor values that monitor a variety of system resources (e.g., memory usage, processor usage, thread count). The technique allows users to specify the relative importance of precision and recall, and builds a utility function to meet those requirements. We evaluated the technique on the open source Jigsaw web server using ten resource usage metrics and five anomalous behaviors in the form of injected faults in the Jigsaw code and a security attack. To assess the effectiveness of the technique, the precision and recall of the evolved utility function was compared to that of a hand-crafted utility function that uses a simple thresholding scheme. The results show that the evolved function outperformed the hand-crafted function by 10 percent.},

A godsend for library developers, compiler writers, and lovers of elegant hacks, it deserves a spot on your shelf right next to Knuth.""--Josh Bloch""When I first saw the title, I figured that the book must be either a cookbook for breaking into computers (unlikely) or some sort of compendium of little programming tricks. It's the latter, but it's thorough, almost encyclopedic, in its coverage." "--Guy SteeleThese are the timesaving techniques relished by computer hackers--those devoted and persistent code developers who seek elegant and efficient ways to build better software. The truth is that much of the computer programmer's job involves a healthy mix of arithmetic and logic. In "Hacker's Delight," veteran programmer Hank Warren shares the tricks he has collected from his considerable experience in the worlds of application and system programming. Most of these techniques are eminently practical, but a few are included just because they are interesting and unexpected. The resulting work is an irresistible collection that will help even the most seasoned programmers better their craft.Topics covered include: A broad collection of useful programming tricks Small algorithms for common tasksPower-of-2 boundaries and bounds checkingRearranging bits and bytesInteger division and division by constantsSome elementary functions on integersGray codeHilbert's space-filling curveAnd even formulas for prime numbers!This book is for anyone who wants to create efficient code. "Hacker's Delight" will help you learn to program at a higher level--well beyond what is generally taught in schools and training courses--and will advance you substantially further than is possible through ordinary self-study alone. 0201914654B06272002},

abstract = {The change history of a software project contains a rich collection of code changes that record previous development experience. Changes that fix bugs are especially interesting, since they record both the old buggy code and the new fixed code. This paper presents a bug finding algorithm using bug fix memories: a project-specific bug and fix knowledge base developed by analyzing the history of bug fixes. A bug finding tool, BugMem, implements the algorithm. The approach is different from bug finding tools based on theorem proving or static model checking such as Bandera, ESC/Java, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD. Since these tools use pre-defined common bug patterns to find bugs, they do not aim to identify project-specific bugs. Bug fix memories use a learning process, so the bug patterns are project-specific, and project-specific bugs can be detected. The algorithm and tool are assessed by evaluating if real bugs and fixes in project histories can be found in the bug fix memories. Analysis of five open source projects shows that, for these projects, 19.3{\%}-40.3{\%} of bugs appear repeatedly in the memories, and 7.9{\%}-15.5{\%} of bug and fix pairs are found in memories. The results demonstrate that project-specific bug fix patterns occur frequently enough to be useful as a bug detection technique. Furthermore, for the bug and fix pairs, it is possible to both detect the bug and provide a strong suggestion for the fix. However, there is also a high false positive rate, with 20.8{\%}-32.5{\%} of non-bug containing changes also having patterns found in the memories. A comparison of BugMem with a bug finding tool, PMD, shows that the bug sets identified by both tools are mostly exclusive, indicating that BugMem complements other bug finding tools.},

abstract = {Bug reports submitted by users and crash reports collected by crash reporting tools often lack information about reproduction steps, i.e. the steps necessary to reproduce a failure. Hence, developers have difficulties to reproduce field failures and might not be able to fix all reported bugs. We present an approach to automatically extract failure reproduction steps from user interaction traces. We capture interactions between a user and a WIMP GUI using a capture/replay tool. Then, we extract the minimal, failure-inducing subsequence of captured interaction traces. We use three algorithms to perform this extraction: Delta Debugging, Sequential Pattern Mining, and a combination of both. Delta Debugging automatically replays subsequences of an interaction trace to identify the minimal, failure-inducing subsequence. Sequential Pattern Mining identifies the common subsequence in interaction traces inducing the same failure. We evaluated our approach in a case study. We injected four bugs to the code of a mail client application, collected interaction traces of five participants trying to find these bugs, and applied the extraction algorithms. Delta Debugging extracted the minimal, failure-inducing interaction subsequence in 90{\%} of all cases. Sequential Pattern Mining produced failure-inducing interaction sequences in 75{\%} of all cases and removed on average 93{\%} of unnecessary interactions, potentially enabling manual analysis by developers. Both algorithms complement each other because they are applicable in different contexts and can be combined to improve performance.},

@article{Cordy2006,
abstract = {TXL is a special-purpose programming language designed for creating, manipulating and rapidly prototyping language descriptions, tools and applications. TXL is designed to allow explicit programmer control over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order functional programming at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides for flexible programming of traversals, guards, scope of application and parameterized context. This flexibility has allowed TXL users to express and experiment with both new ideas in parsing, such as robust, island and agile parsing, and new paradigms in rewriting, such as XML mark-up, rewriting strategies and contextualized rules, without any change to TXL itself. This paper outlines the history, evolution and concepts of TXL with emphasis on its distinctive style and philosophy, and gives examples of its use in expressing and applying recent new paradigms in language processing.},
